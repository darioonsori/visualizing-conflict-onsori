      <p>
        This website explores how data visualization can represent global conflicts and
        humanitarian issues. Using open data from <em>Our World in Data</em> and the
        Uppsala Conflict Data Program, we compare categories with multiple encodings to
        surface different perspectives on the same underlying facts.

        Charts comparing conflict-related deaths by country and conflict type. Snapshot year and
        granularity are indicated per chart. Regional aggregates are excluded from country rankings.
      </p>

      <!-- Chart 1: Top-10 countries -->
      <section class="chart-card">
        <h3>Countries with the highest conflict-related deaths in 2023 (Top 10)</h3>
        <div id="bar-top10-2023"></div>
        <p class="note">
          Horizontal bars compare absolute totals. Values are counts of deaths (combatants and civilians)
          during ongoing armed conflicts. Data source: UCDP via Our World in Data. Regional aggregates
          (e.g., Europe, Africa) are excluded.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Chart 2: Grouped bar by type -->
      <section class="chart-card">
        <h3>Conflict deaths by type (selected countries, 2023)</h3>
        <div id="grouped-2023"></div>
        <p class="note">
          Bars are grouped by country; color encodes conflict type (UCDP categories). Snapshot year: 2023.
          Countries are filtered by valid ISO3 code; regional aggregates and “World” are excluded.
